# Temperature-Controlled-Fan-using-thermistor
This project demonstrates an automatic temperature-controlled fan using an op-amp configured as a comparator and an NTC thermistor. The thermistor produces a temperature-dependent voltage which is continuously compared with a fixed reference voltage. When the sensed temperature exceeds the predefined threshold, the op-amp output saturates high and drives a transistor into conduction, turning the fan ON; below the threshold, the fan remains OFF. The complete circuit is designed and simulated in LTspice, and temperature sweep analysis confirms sharp and reliable switching behavior. This project highlights core analog electronics principles and serves as a simple, microcontroller-free temperature control solution.
